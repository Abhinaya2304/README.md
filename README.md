# About Me

Hi, I’m Abhinaya, a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate from Chennai.  
I like working on small projects that solve practical problems and help me understand how technology is used in real life.

I spend my time improving my programming skills and experimenting with ideas through academic work and hackathons. I prefer learning by doing and enjoy collaborating with others during team-based events.

## Technical Background
- Programming languages: C, C++, Java, Python (intermediate level)
- Basic web application development
- Introductory knowledge of machine learning and exploratory data analysis
- Object-oriented programming and fundamental data structures
- Tools I use regularly: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code

## Projects
- **Brain Tumor Detection** – a Java-based academic project focused on analyzing medical inputs  
- **Medicine Combination Safety Checker** – a web application that checks whether medicine combinations are safe and shows possible side effects  
- **WellBeingWare** – a Python-based web application that asks simple daily questions to understand mood and provides positive messages  
- **Iris Dataset Analysis** – exploratory analysis to study patterns and relationships in data

## Activities and Learning
- NPTEL certified in Programming in Java
- Participated in several college and inter-college hackathons
- Attended a workshop on Generative Artificial Intelligence

I’m interested in continuing to learn through projects, teamwork, and hands-on experimentation.
